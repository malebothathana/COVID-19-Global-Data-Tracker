# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Data Tracker 📊

Welcome to the **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker**!  
This is a data-driven project where i dive into real-world COVID-19 data to uncover how the pandemic has impacted countries like **Kenya, USA, India, Brazil, and Germany**.

## 🚀 What’s This Project About?

I analyzed global COVID-19 trends using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus).  
I explored:
- 📈 How total cases and deaths evolved over time
- 💉 The speed and reach of vaccination efforts
- 🌍 Global snapshots using a beautiful choropleth map
- 🔍 Insights into death rates, daily new cases, and more!

## 📁 What's Inside

- `covid19_data_tracker.ipynb`: Your main notebook with all the code, graphs, and insights.
- `README.md`: This very file — your friendly project guide.
- *(Place `owid-covid-data.csv` here manually)*

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **pandas**
- **matplotlib & seaborn**
- **plotly.express**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🧼 What Did We Do?

1. **Collected data** from OWID.
2. **Cleaned it** (dates, missing values, filtering).
3. **Explored trends** (cases, deaths, vaccinations).
4. **Visualized globally** with a choropleth map.
5. **Wrote insights** in Markdown.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- US and India had the most cases.
- Kenya had a slower vaccine rollout.
- Brazil had high early death rates.
- Countries with more vaccines saw fewer new cases.

## ✅ How to Run This Notebook

1. Download `owid-covid-data.csv`: https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv  
2. Place it in this folder.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter.
4. Run all cells.

## 💬 Final Thoughts


This project provided a powerful, hands-on opportunity to explore the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic through real-world data. By analyzing trends in confirmed cases, deaths, and vaccinations across multiple countries, i gained a clearer understanding of how the virus affected different regions and how public health responses evolved over time.

Through visual storytelling and Python-powered data analysis, i saw not only the scale of the crisis but also the progress made through vaccinations and international efforts. This analysis reinforces the importance of accessible data in guiding decisions, preparing for future health challenges, and appreciating the human stories behind the numbers.

In the end, this project wasn't just about statistics — it was about turning data into insight, and insight into understanding.


## 🧾 was it worth it?

Wow — what a journey! This COVID-19 tracker project was more than just writing code and making charts. It helped me really see how the pandemic unfolded across the world. From tracking total cases and deaths to visualizing how vaccinations rolled out in different countries, I got to turn raw data into real insights.

It’s crazy how much you can learn just by looking at the numbers in the right way. I also learned a lot about using Python tools like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn — and how powerful they are for telling stories with data.

### 💭 Personal Reflection & Challenges

At first, I found working with a large dataset overwhelming, and handling missing values or date formatting took a bit of trial and error. Some of the graphs didn’t show up right away, and I had to debug a few things, especially with syntax. But figuring them out made the learning process even more satisfying.

This project not only improved my coding and data analysis skills, but also gave me more confidence in working through real-world problems. I’m proud of how everything came together!
